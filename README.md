A blockchian based cafe.



# Key learnings
* While building this project, I also read the book "The Lean Startup"
* Blockchain is a database.
* Every blockchain starts with a Genesis file which is used to distribute the first tokens to early members of the chain. It is never updated afterwards.
* A whitepaper servers to outline the specifications of how the particular blockchain will look and behave.
* It uses a event based architecture where the dB is the final aggregated stare after replaying all the transactions in a specific queue.
